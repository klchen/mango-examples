/*
    All of the streaming interfaces are super light-weight and
    every decision is done at compile time; the correct code is called
    directly without any dispatching logic.

    This line of code:
    uint32 x = p.read32();

    Would see that we are reading from, say, Little Endian pointer and
    that we are compiling for little endian architecture, thus no
    translation will be required. The data will be fetched using
    unaligned memory read operation. The load operation is selected using
    compile time information about the architecture and how it handles
    alignment. It will just work. However, if the client can guarantee
    correct alignment the memory load operation could potentially be
    more efficient.

    This is equal to doing this:
    char* p = ...;
    uint32 x = *reinterpret_cast<uint32 *>(p);
    p += sizeof(uint32);

    The difference is that our way is less typing and always guaranteed
    to be correct and use the best available implementation.
