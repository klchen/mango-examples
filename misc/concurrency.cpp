    // OK; synchronization like this is pointless on it's own since we can
    // get the same effect with q.wait(). However, this pattern can be used
    // as a building-block for greater things. The multicore-programming
    // wisdom is that when your thread will block, don't put it into a pool.

    // It would be very bad to block a pool with a sleeping thread.
    // What you want to do is to launch free-standing thread for any
    // activity that will block a thread. When a thread is being blocked
    // for any reason (waiting for I/O, waiting for work to complete, etc.)
    // this thread should be sleeping. A sleeping thread does not consume
    // CPU time or energy. A sleeping thread is good.

    // There are many ways to go about this. One way is to use std::promise
    // and std::future which allow to wait-for-result, in practise, sleep
    // until the result is available. This is pretty nice way to pair the
    // MANGO ThreadPool with free-standing threads. The downside is that
    // the communication "channel", if you will, is the heap. This implies
    // dynamic memory allocation. This might be an issue for some so keep
    // that in mind. It's the way of the modern computing world so whatever.

    // The other approach is to use condition variables. These allow the
    // result collector to sleep until notified that the results are
    // available. Both work; which one is better choise depends on many
    // factors which are outside the scope of this small code example.

            // The ThreadPool is currently able to process 10,000,000 tasks

            // memory operations to implement lock-free inter-thread communication.
            // A similar design using mutex/locking can do roughly 200,000 tasks
            // per second on a similar hardware. The bottleneck is how to feed
            // the ThreadPool enough work if the tasks are really trivial. A good
            // rule-of-thumb to keep the system responsive is to keep the tasks
            // short enough but not too short (for example, incrementing a counter

    // be deadlocked and our program would hang.

    // It is very easy to paint yourself into the corner like this and generally NEVER
    // sleep or wait for a signal from other tasks in a thread pool.

    // However, our queue wait is implemented as a cooperative-wait so it will help
    // executing tasks in a pool. The unfortunate downside is that this increases latency
    // slightly since the wait might still be currently processing a task not related
    // to the current queue's wait status. The upside is that the pool cannot be
    // deadlocked with wait. Even if task being processed in a wait has a wait in it,
    // that wait will be cooperative as well and we degenerate into recursion but this
    // should be extremely rare, in practise non-existent if the idea to never wait in a
    // task is followed.

    // The takeaway is that if you really, absolutely have to synchronize in a enqueued
    // task then use the queue wait. It's better to have implicit synchronization by
    // NOT issuing any tasks before the data is available (eg. trigger a task when the
    // data is known to be available). Just friendly advice, feel free to ignore and cry.
